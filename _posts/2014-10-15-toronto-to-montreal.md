Yesterday, [we published an article examining the high percentage of candidates for city council that live outside the ward they are running in](/2014/10/14/running-close-to-home/). It is [not the first article to examine this question](http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/10/12/peter-kuitenbrouwer-representation-from-the-outside/). During the 2010 municipal election, [an article on this same topic](http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/10/12/peter-kuitenbrouwer-representation-from-the-outside/) was published by the National Post. 

In this election, if you add up the distances of candidates for city council who live outside of their ward, the total distance is 542 kilometres, which is roughly the distance between Toronto and Montreal. 

We have updated the [profile pages](http://everycandidate.org/candidates/#toronto-council) here on Every Candidate so that you can now look up each candidate and see if they live outside the ward and, if so, how far away they live.

Let us know what you think in the comments.
