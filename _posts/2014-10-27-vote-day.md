Voting day is here. All (two!) of us at Every Candidate hope that you'll make your voice heard in this election. Make sure you find out where to vote and what information you might be required to bring on the city's [My Vote](http://app.toronto.ca/vote/myVote.do) site. Before you head to the poll, take time to review some of the best resources we could find to guide your decisions today:
